Fake Facebook like buttons

Have you ever wanted to share a different reaction than "Like"? I've created some other options, that have an identical look and feel to the original Facebook like button, and even remember if you've clicked them, like the real Facebook like button.

Try clicking:

Chill
Punch this
Rock this
Fuck this
Put a ring on this
Like, whatever

Embeddable iframes that store whether a user has clicked them with a simple cookie.

You can find them here: http://www.inorganik.net/?p=904
Or in the iframes.html doc.
